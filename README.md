### 1.)Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis

This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
The Dataset
The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:
meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz), sd: standard deviation of frequency,median: median frequency (in kHz),Q25: first quantile (in kHz),Q75: third quantile (in kHz),IQR: interquantile range (in kHz),skew: skewness (see note in specprop description),kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description),sp.ent: spectral entropy,sfm: spectral flatness,mode: mode frequency,centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop),peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy),meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal,minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal,maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal,meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal,mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal,maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal,modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range,label: male or female

EDA

1: The histogram of  Distribution of Spectral Flatness Histogram shows that the distribution of spectral flatness values varies across the dataset. There appear to be differences between the male and female voice samples in terms of this feature. The separation suggests that spectral flatness might be informative for distinguishing between genders based on voice characteristics.

2. The histogram of Distribution of Average Fundamental Frequency Histogram illustrates that  "meanfun” (average fundamental frequency) values have distinct distributions for male and female voice samples. There is a noticeable difference between the two genders, indicating that this feature might be relevant for gender classification.

3. Label Balance Verification Pie Chart shows the distribution of the two gender labels ("Male" and "Female") in the dataset.It indicates that the dataset has a relatively balanced representation of male and female voice samples. This balance is essential for training models without class bias.

4. Label Balance Verification Count Plot depicts the count of male and female voice samples using bars. The count plot further confirms that the dataset has a balanced distribution of male and female samples. This balance enhances the credibility of the dataset for building unbiased machine learning models.

5. Correlation Heatmap visually represents the correlations between different acoustic features.The heatmap helps identify potential correlations between features. Darker colors represent stronger correlations. Features with high positive or negative correlations might be interrelated and could provide useful information for the models.

6. Correlation Coefficient Bar Plot The bar plot displays the correlation coefficients of features with the gender label. This plot highlights the features that have higher correlations with the gender label. Features with larger coefficients might have more predictive power for gender classification.

The above machine learning models produced varying levels of accuracy in predicting gender based on acoustic voice features. The Random Forest classifier stood out with the highest accuracy, while other models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier also demonstrated strong performances. However Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier showed least accuracy.These results showcase the models' abilities to learn and generalize from the provided dataset.


Better Performance Of Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest classifier's superior performance can be attributed to its ensemble nature, which combines multiple decision trees' predictions to mitigate overfitting risks. This averaging reduces variance, aiding generalization to unseen data. Through random sampling and feature selection, the algorithm introduces decorrelation among trees, enhancing overall performance. Moreover, it gauges feature importance by ranking contributions to impurity reduction, aiding feature selection. Handling non-linearity adeptly, it captures intricate feature interactions without demanding explicit engineering. Robust to outliers and noise, it benefits from averaging across trees. Striking a balance between bias and variance, it generalizes well. Adaptability to high-dimensional data without overfitting, driven by the combination of trees and randomization, establishes its reliability for complex datasets.

Reason for poor performance of Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier
The Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier's diminished accuracy can be attributed to several inherent assumptions and limitations. GNB relies on the naive assumption of feature independence given the class label, which often doesn't hold true in real-world scenarios where features can correlate. It's sensitive to continuous features following Gaussian distributions, hindering its adaptability to non-conforming data. GNB struggles to grasp complex feature interactions, a significant factor in gender voice recognition. Lacking inherent feature importance measures hampers its ability to leverage informative attributes. Skewed predictions due to imbalanced data are a concern. GNB's simplicity can lead to underfitting in complex datasets, impacting performance. Parameter sensitivity and its basic assumptions limit optimization. Given these constraints, other algorithms like Random Forest, which can address non-linearity and interaction complexities, might better suit gender voice recognition tasks.
	



### 2.)Road Accident Analysis And Severity Prediction

The dataset used in this analysis focuses on road casualty statistics, aiming to explore the factors influencing the severity of road accidents. It contains information about various attributes related to road accidents, casualties, vehicles, and contextual factors. The data includes features such as casualty class, age of casualty, gender of casualty, casualty type, vehicle reference, accident year, and more. Additionally, the dataset includes categorical attributes such as home area type, vehicle reference, accident year, and various location-related values. The dataset's purpose is to analyze patterns, correlations, and potential predictive relationships between these attributes and the severity of road accident casualties. The analysis involves data visualization techniques to gain insights and the application of machine learning models to predict casualty severity based on the available features.


 Age Band and Casualty Type: The "age_band_and_type" variable combines information about the age band of the casualty and the type of casualty. 2. Accident Year: The "accident_year" variable represents the year in which the accident occurred , 3. Vehicle Reference: The "vehicle_reference" variable denotes the reference number of the vehicle involved in the accident. 
4. Status::The "status" variable indicates the status of the accident. 5.Accident Reference:The "accident_reference" variable represents a reference number for the accident. 6. Casualty IMD Decile:The "casualty_imd_decile" variable denotes the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile of the casualty. 7. LSOA of Casualty:The "lsoa_of_casualty" variable provides information about the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) associated with the casualty. 8. Casualty Reference:The "casualty_reference" variable represents a reference number for the casualty. 9. Age and Sex Interaction::An interaction term "age_sex_interaction" was created by multiplying the age band of the casualty by the sex of the casualty10. Numeric Variables:Numeric variables like "longitude", "latitude", "age_of_casualty", "number_of_vehicles", and "number_of_casualties" were also present. These variables were part of the initial data preprocessing and were included in the machine learning models. Correlation analysis using a heatmap helped us understand the relationships between these numeric variables.



Data Visualization
The data visualization component of the analysis presents a visual exploration of the road accident dataset using a variety of graphical representations. Created using Seaborn in Python, these visualizations play a pivotal role in comprehending data relationships and patterns. They offer insights into potential trends and correlations within the dataset. Notably, box plots were used to showcase casualty severity distribution across age bands and casualty types, and to depict the influence of factors like vehicle references, accident statuses, and IMD decile on casualty severity. Count plots provided a temporal view of accident occurrences over different years and unveiled the frequency of specific vehicle and accident references. Additionally, line plots displayed the average casualty severity over time. Collectively, these visualizations offer a clear and concise means of grasping the dataset's nuances, paving the way for more precise predictions and informed decision-making.

 Machine Learning Models
Performance Report of Machine Learning Models for Casualty Severity Prediction

We have used two  machine learning models, namely Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor, in predicting casualty severity based on a road accident dataset. The models were evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and predictive power.


1. Random Forest Regressor:

The Random Forest Regressor was applied to predict casualty severity. It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. The model was trained using 80% of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining 20% (testing set).

The Random Forest Regressor model's performance on the test data is as follows:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.4314
R-squared (R²) Score: 0.0254
These values provide insights into how well the Random Forest model is predicting casualty severity based on the given features. The RMSE value of 0.4314 indicates the average deviation of predicted severity values from the actual severity values, and the low R² score of 0.0254 suggests that the model's ability to explain the variance in the target variable (casualty severity) is limited.

2. Gradient Boosting Regressor:
The hyperparameter tuning results for the Gradient Boosting Regressor model are as follows:

| Learning Rate | Number of Estimators | RMSE     | R²       |

| 0.01              | 100                                       | 0.431906 | 0.023196 |
| 0.01              | 200                                       | 0.430477 | 0.029646 |
| 0.01              | 300                                       | 0.429894 | 0.032276 |
| 0.10              | 100                                       | 0.429427 | 0.034374 |
| 0.10           | 200                                           | 0.429501 | 0.034041 |
| 0.10           | 300                                           | 0.429588 | 0.033650 |
| 0.20           | 100                                           | 0.429627 | 0.033476 |
| 0.20           | 200                                           | 0.429685 | 0.033216 |
| 0.20           | 300                                           | 0.429689 | 0.033198 |


The table provides the results of evaluating the Gradient Boosting Regressor model with different combinations of learning rates and the number of estimators. The RMSE values indicate the root mean squared error between the predicted casualty severity values and the actual values, while the R² values represent the coefficient of determination indicating how well the model's predictions match the actual data. Among these combinations, combination 0 (Learning Rate: 0.01, Number of Estimators: 300) seems to have the lowest RMSE (0.429894) and the highest R² (0.032276), making it a potentially better choice among the combinations tested.


Why Gradient Boosting performed better than Random Forest?
Gradient Boosting performed better than Random Forest in predicting casualty severity due to its sequential learning approach and ability to capture complex relationships in the data. It focuses on minimizing errors and assigning higher importance to predictive features, resulting in improved accuracy. Although Random Forest is robust and handles outliers effectively, Gradient Boosting's strengths in handling intricate patterns, feature importance prioritization, and regularization likely contributed to its superior performance. Careful parameter tuning is essential for Gradient Boosting, while Random Forest is simpler to use. The selection between the two depends on dataset characteristics and analysis objectives.


Conclusion: In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of the variables in the road accident dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing casualty severity. The combination of data visualization and machine learning techniques contributed to a deeper understanding of the dataset and paved the way for accurate predictions and informed decision-making in road safety.







 ### 3.)Credit Card Fraud Detection:

 
In this data science project, we address the critical issue of credit card fraud detection using machine learning and Python. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, fraudsters continually seek ways to exploit vulnerabilities. We analyze a real-world credit card transaction dataset and employ various anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM to identify fraudulent activities. The project focuses on achieving a balance between precision and recall to minimize both false positives and false negatives, ensuring that genuine transactions are not mistakenly flagged as fraudulent. By successfully detecting and preventing credit card fraud, this project serves as a powerful tool to protect customers and financial institutions from potential financial losses.
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.









### 4.)Predicting The Onset Of Diabetes Using Diagnostic Measures 


The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset is a collection of medical records for 768 Pima Indian women. The records include information on age, weight, height, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The dataset has been used to study the risk factors for diabetes and to develop machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.
Variables used here Pregnancies denoting Number of pregnancies ,Glucose denoting 2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test, Blood Pressure denotes Blood Pressure Diastolic)(mm Hg),SkinThickness  denotes  Thickness of skin and Insulin  denotes 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml), DiabetesPedigreeFunction  which is a function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test),BMI which is Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in meters)^2),Age denoting  Persons age(in years) and finally
Outcome which denotes  diabetes status (1: diabetes, 0: no diabetes)
The target variable is specified as "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive result of the diabetes test and 0 indicates a negative result.
A machine learning model is to be developed that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not when their features are given. 
Missing Values Check:
When we checked for missing values in the data set, we got the answer that there is no missing value. However, we observed a value of 0 in values such as Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI in our dataset. These values cannot be 0. So we will replace these 0 values with NaN.

EDA
The bar graph tells us that the behaviors of those with diabetes are around 35%, while those without diabetes are around 65%.
Histogram for pregnancies, SkinThickness ,Insulin, DiabetsPedigreeFunction ,Age is positively skewed, for glucose it is negatively skewed and   symmetric for BloodPressure, BMI
For people without diabetes (Outcome 0):On average, they have around 3.3 pregnancies,Their average glucose level is about 110,Their average blood pressure is approximately 68,The average thickness of their skin is about 19.7,They have an average insulin level of roughly 68.8,Their average BMI (body mass index) is around 30.3,The average value of a diabetes-related metric is approximately 0.43,Their average age is about 31.2 years

For people with diabetes (Outcome 1): On average, they have around 4.9 pregnancies. Their average glucose level is higher, about 141.3.Their average blood pressure is also higher, around 70.8.The average thickness of their skin is a bit more, about 22.2.They have a higher average insulin level, about 100.3.Their average BMI is notably higher, around 35.1.The average value of the diabetes-related metric is slightly higher, about 0.55. and their average age is higher as well, about 37.1 years
There are no missing values in any of the columns. This is beneficial because it means that all the data we have in our Dataset is complete and doesn't have any missing information in any of the columns. This can make our analysis more accurate and reliable since we have complete information for each data point.
The bar chart will have bars that represent each column in your DataFrame. The height of each bar represents the proportion of missing values in that column. If a column has no missing values, its bar will be full. If a column has many missing values, its bar will be shorter. This visual representation helps us to quickly understand which columns have missing data.

The heatmap representation is a grid where each cell corresponds to a column and a row. If a cell is blank, it means there are no missing values for that column and row combination. If a cell is colored, it indicates missing values. The color intensity or shade may represent the proportion of missing values.From heatmap we find a high correlation between SkinThickness and insulin

Modelling:
We have used 3 Machine Learning Models :Random Forest Classifier,Logistic Regression Model,XGBOOST classifier.
Accuracy of randomforest classifier model is 88.3% that is the RandomForest model correctly predicted the outcome for around 88.3 instances out of 100 instances

Accuracy of logistic regression model is 77.92% that is the  model  correctly predicted the outcome for around 77.92instances out of 100 instances

Accuracy of XGBOOST classifier is 89.6% that is the  model  correctly predicted the outcome for around 89.6 instances out of 100 instances
Highest accuracy of prediction comes from XGBOOST classifier whereas the lowest comes from Logistic Regression Model

Possible reasons for better performance of XGBOOST classifier:

 XGBoost is an ensemble model that combines multiple weak learners. This can improve prediction accuracy by aggregating the strengths of individual models .The dataset contains complex relationships between the features and the target variable. XGBoost's ability to capture nonlinear relationships through decision trees  helps it model these complexities more effectively compared to other . XGBoost's ability to capture such interactions  leads to improved accuracy. XGBoost's built-in regularization techniques (like L1 and L2 regularization) helps prevent overfitting. In a dataset with limited samples like the Pima dataset, overfitting can be a concern, and XGBoost's regularization leads to better generalization. XGBoost has a wide range of hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize performance for a specific dataset. This extensive tuning capability can lead to better performance on the Pima dataset. 

The lower accuracy of logistic regression compared to random forest and XGBoost classifiers on the Pima Indian diabetes dataset could be due to several factors:

Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable. If the relationship in the data is non-linear, as is often the case with medical data, logistic regression might struggle to capture the complexity. Random forests and XGBoost are more capable of capturing non-linear relationships due to their ensemble nature and ability to create decision boundaries that are more flexible. : Random forests and XGBoost are ensemble methods, meaning they combine multiple base models (decision trees) to make a final prediction. This ensemble nature allows them to reduce overfitting and improve generalization by combining the strengths of multiple models. Logistic regression is a single linear model and might overfit or underfit the data more easily. 
Scope for further study:
The dataset can be used to identify factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. This information can be used to develop interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes in high-risk individuals.It can be used to identify new targets for drug development. For example, researchers may be able to identify genes or proteins that are involved in the development of diabetes and develop drugs that target these molecules.The dataset can be used to identify effective strategies for preventing diabetes.
